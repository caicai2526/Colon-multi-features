# Colon-multi-features
#### CRC Prognostic analysis

# Introduction
> Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant tumor within digestive tract with both high incidence rate and and mortality. Early detection and intervention could improve patient clinical outcome and survival. This study computationally investigate a set of prognostic tissue and celluer features from diagnostic tissue slide. With the combination of clinical prognostic variable, the pathological image features could predict the prognosis in CRC patients.In this paper, we analyze microenvironmental features, deep network features, and clinical features in colorectal cancer pathological images. And through the fusion of multiple modal features, the prognosis and survival of patients are predicted. the model has obtained relatively good prediction results.

The code in this progject will reproduce the results in our paper submitted to Bioinformatics, "Prognostic analysis based on multi-feature calculation and clinical information fusion of colorectal cancer whole slide pathological image". Code is written in matlab and python.

# Methods
> ### Prognostic analysis process based on WSI of Colorectal Cancer Histopathology Images
![main process](https://github.com/caicai2526/Colon-multi-features/blob/main/Fig/fig1.jpg)
  > 1. Using [Deeptissue Net](https://github.com/caicai2526) to segment different tissue region
